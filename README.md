Python Project - Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

In this repository, I will be posting my project codes. Motivation from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron"



Types of Machine Learning Systems
There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories based on:

Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)

Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)

Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)
