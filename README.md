# Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-and-TensorFlow
Python Project - Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

In this repository, I will be posting my project codes motivated from the topics in the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron"

One big insight I learned is : 

How to start a Machine Learning project. 

There are eight main steps:
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
